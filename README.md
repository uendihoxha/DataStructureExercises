# DataStructureExercises
Weiss source code is used to perform the given exercises. The following data types are covered: 

1. STACKS:an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity. 
It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order. Every time an element is added, it goes on the top of the stack and the only element that can be removed is the element that is at the top of the stack, just like a pile of objects.

2. QUEUE: an abstract data type or a linear data structure, just like stack data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end called the REAR(also called tail), and the removal of existing element takes place from the other end called as FRONT(also called head).
This makes queue as FIFO(First in First Out) data structure, which means that element inserted first will be removed first. The process to add an element into queue is called Enqueue and the process of removal of an element from queue is called Dequeue.

3. LINKED LISTS: a very commonly used linear data structure which consists of group of nodes in a sequence.Each node holds its own data and the address of the next node hence forming a chain like structure.
Linked Lists are used to create trees and graphs.

4. DOUBLY LINKED LISTS: a type of linked list in which each node apart from storing its data has two links. The first link points to the previous node in the list and the second link points to the next node in the list. 
The first node of the list has its previous link pointing to NULL similarly the last node of the list has its next node pointing to NULL.
